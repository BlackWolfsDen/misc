a while ago i was helping with a Premium script , 
trying to add a vendor  window via player , rather than using a World Object. 
but i never got a working test script so i forgot bout the idea  until Unknown96
ask me about it.i lookd over his script and deciced to take another try at it and poof
her it is. now a player can open a vendor window via chat command.
